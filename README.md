# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3x3 square grid. Two players, X and O, play against each other. They must each take turns filling a square of the grid with the symbol assigned to them: X or O. To determine which player will start the game, a pack of 52 cards is shuffled and distributed randomly between the two players. The player who has the largest card (Ace of Spades) will start the game. The winner is the player who can align three identical symbols, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
Using python, I tried to code this game.
